dynamic cpu frequency control
Working on an AMD bulldozer architecture to dynamically lower the frequency when fetching data from memory and raising it back when the processor is needed to work on the data. This effort is done in an attempt to lower the energy used by the CPU when it is waiting for data to be moved around and is not being utilised.
